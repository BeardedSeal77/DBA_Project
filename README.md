Project Overview

This is a database solution designed for an online bookstore. The project involves the design and implementation of a relational database in Oracle, incorporating all the critical entities and relationships required for efficient data management. The database is accessible through a web-based UI, which allows users to query and interact with the stored information seamlessly.


## 🎯 Requirements Fulfilled

### 🧠 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An ERD was designed to model the relationships between key entities, including Book, Author, Order, Order Detail, and Customer.

The ERD reflects:
- One-to-many relationships between authors and books.
- One-to-many relationships between orders and order details.
- One-to-many relationships between customers and orders.
- Question 2: Oracle Database Implementation - [80 Marks]

### 🤖 Installation and Configuration
Oracle Database was installed and configured on a Windows/Linux machine, meeting all system requirements.

### 📒 Database Creation and Configuration
Tables, views, and indexes were created to support the bookstore operations efficiently.
Normalization techniques were applied to reduce redundancy and improve performance.

### 👷 Data Population and Querying
Data was populated using SQL*Loader Utility.
SQL queries were written for data retrieval, including complex joins and conditional filters.

### 🔒 Security Implementation

Users and roles were created with granular access privileges.
Password policies and auditing were configured to enhance security.

### 💻 Database Monitoring and Documentation

Performance monitoring was conducted, and any identified issues were documented and resolved.

### 🧑‍💻 Additional Features

- Transaction Auditing: All database transactions are recorded for security and debugging purposes.

- Multiple Table Input Procedures: Streamlined multi-table inserts to optimize database operations.

- Website UI: A user-friendly interface to interact with the database and perform real-time queries.
